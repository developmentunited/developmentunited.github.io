                    <div>
                        Development United started as a research project within the department of Global Health and Social Medicine at King’s College London. It was spearheaded by a group of passionate students who realized that the system of development assistance we currently exist in is highly inefficient.
                        Their research revealed that one of the largest reasons that this system is so inefficient is because collaboration within the field of international development is often not feasible or ineffective. To address this problem, Development United was formed.

                    Optimistic Innovation: “We see the existence of millions of NGOs and billions of dollars in aid investment…” —> “We see the existence of millions of development projects and billions of dollars invested into development assistance with such little output…”

                    Unity: “This allows donors, NGOs, volunteers, and beneficiaries all to take advantage… We believe that we are all in a fight for global equity together” —> “This allows donors, development workers and organizations, and beneficiaries all to take advantage … We believe that we are all in a fight for global equality together”

                    Effective Altruism: —> “We believe that one of the most important things in development assistance is not just donating, but donating to the interventions that will have the highest social impact. Not only is Development United proud to provide development workers and organizations with data and information that can increase the effectiveness of their intervention, but we are also proud to provide organizations and donors with the opportunity to fund and publicize collaborative projects.

                    Making the world a better place: —> “Every decision we make at Development United is made with the mindset of ‘which will make the world the best place it can be?’”
